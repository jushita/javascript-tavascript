## leetcode.js

This file contains solution to problems from Leetcode. (https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/)

### Problems:
1. Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
```
Input: [1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 4
```
2. Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one without using extra memory.
3. Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.
But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

```
Example:
n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",s
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]
```
4. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.
```
Example:
Given s = "hello", return "olleh".
```
5. Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
6. Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
```
Example:
input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```
7. 7. Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. Not in place.
8. Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
9. Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
10. Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s. Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
```
For example,
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
s = "rat", t = "car", return false.
```
11.
12. Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
```
Example 1:
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
